# PersonalExpenseTracker
I wanted to see my own total expenses of staying 1 year in Canada. However, CIBC is not providing such insights. I decided to create my own insights using the powerful tool Microsoft Excel so that I can sharpen my Excel skills and get an overview of how much I spend & earning throughout 1 year time period. Let me tell how I created this visualization. 
- Downloaded data from CIBC Bank, Canada in CSV format.
- Merge chequing, savings, and credit card transactions into one sheet.
- Covert data into categories.
- Used Pivot tVLOOKUP, Remove Duplicates, and other formulas.
